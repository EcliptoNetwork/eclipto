      There are three pathways for this. One details learning research fundamentals
       (ex. cold emailing).
       The second is an individual research pathway, which is conducting 
       individual research and submitting it to Eclipto to be shown in our archive, 
       and/or published in our upcoming journal (Team Leads will support 
       individual
       researchers upon request). The third includes forming 
       groups of around 4-7 people to conduct & write a paper 
       on a topic of interest! The paper goes 
       into the Eclipto archive, and can be published in our 
       journal. For pathways two and three, the resulting 
       papers can either be published in our journal OR we 
       can help find another one.

      <h3 className="subhead-text text-orange-200">Our System</h3>
      <p className="mt-5 flex flex-col gap-3 text-white">
      Our organization is centered around a point system. Points can be earned in various
      ways, from being active & helping other members to completing daily/weekly/montly 
      challenges and winning the competitions. Points can be used
      to exchange for various rewards (which are still being decided in our Discord,
      but current ideas include volunteer hours 
      for the PVSA & access to exclusive courses)
      Teams can choose to recruit a member based on the number of points 
      the person has earned during the month, regardless of whether the member has already spent the points.
      (ex. a Team Lead can decide to set a limit to 
      only accept those who have earned more than 100 points.) Points are reset every month, to make it fair for new members!

      <h3 className="subhead-text text-orange-200">Competition Initiative</h3>
      <p className="mt-5 flex flex-col gap-3 text-white">
      There are three categories of competitions. Individual, Team, and Article. While the 
      specific competitions are still being planned out, our current path for monthly 
      competitions is to give winners
      30 points for 1st place, 20 points for 2nd place, and 10 points for 3rd place. In addition
      to points, the winners also get a special tag on their work when it gets put into our site/journal/archive! Additional
      rewards are still being decided.
